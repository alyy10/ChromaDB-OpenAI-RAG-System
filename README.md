# ChromaDB-OpenAI RAG System

A sophisticated Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system built specifically for insurance policy document analysis and question-answering. This system combines the power of ChromaDB vector database, OpenAI's language models, and advanced document processing techniques to provide accurate, context-aware responses to insurance-related queries.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

<img width="2023" height="3840" alt="ProjectArchitecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1715e988-c820-4d11-87d3-d8b4e453e999" />

The system follows a two-phase architecture:

### Phase 1: Ingestion & Indexing
1. **Document Upload**: Users upload PDF policy documents
2. **Text Extraction**: PDF Plumber processes documents, extracting both text and tables while preserving formatting
3. **Embedding Generation**: Sentence Transformers create vector embeddings from processed text chunks
4. **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB stores embeddings with metadata for efficient similarity search

### Phase 2: Query & Generation
1. **Query Processing**: User queries are embedded using the same sentence transformer model
2. **Semantic Search**: ChromaDB retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on vector similarity
3. **Result Reranking**: Cross-encoder model reranks results for improved relevance
4. **Response Generation**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 generates comprehensive answers with document citations
